Main Inspiration:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfhbBaEcybmgidDH3RX_qzFM0mIxWJa21 - while a tutorial for Unity, which I used for the Unity engine, I applied many of the same ideas in Unreal.

https://youtu.be/CYiHNbAIp4s - I used this to figure out how to use the Enhanced Input system, and as a start for my own first person controller.
